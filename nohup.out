#7 0.746 
#7 0.746 × This environment is externally managed
#7 0.746 ╰─> 
#7 0.746     The system-wide python installation should be maintained using the system
#7 0.746     package manager (apk) only.
#7 0.746     
#7 0.746     If the package in question is not packaged already (and hence installable via
#7 0.746     "apk add py3-somepackage"), please consider installing it inside a virtual
#7 0.746     environment, e.g.:
#7 0.746     
#7 0.746     python3 -m venv /path/to/venv
#7 0.746     . /path/to/venv/bin/activate
#7 0.746     pip install mypackage
#7 0.746     
#7 0.746     To exit the virtual environment, run:
#7 0.746     
#7 0.746     deactivate
#7 0.746     
#7 0.746     The virtual environment is not deleted, and can be re-entered by re-sourcing
#7 0.746     the activate file.
#7 0.746     
#7 0.746     To automatically manage virtual environments, consider using pipx (from the
#7 0.746     pipx package).
#7 0.746 
#7 0.746 note: If you believe this is a mistake, please contact your Python installation or OS distribution provider. You can override this, at the risk of breaking your Python installation or OS, by passing --break-system-packages.
#7 0.746 hint: See PEP 668 for the detailed specification.
